# NovaCloud-ISMS-Portal

NovaCloud-ISMS-Portal is a single-page interactive web application designed to transform static ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS) documentation into a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard. It provides employees, auditors, and stakeholders with a centralized platform to explore policies, responsibilities, and compliance objectives in real time.

This project simulates how a medium-to-large organization can digitize its ISMS framework, making compliance governance more transparent, accessible, and engaging.
